Stock Price Prediction Analysis
This project focuses on predicting stock prices using various machine learning models. It includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment.

Overview
The goal of this project is to develop a reliable model for predicting stock prices. By accurately forecasting stock prices, investors can make informed decisions regarding buying, selling, or holding stocks. This analysis explores different machine learning algorithms and techniques to identify the most effective model for stock price prediction.

Methodology
The analysis follows the following steps:

Data Sourcing: Obtain historical market data, including the required features (wap, bid/ask price, bid/ask size, seconds in bucket) for various stocks. Additionally, source the synthetic index data from Optiver, as they constructed the index specifically for this competition.

Data Exploration: Explore and understand the dataset. Analyze distributions, correlations, and patterns present in the data to gain insights into the relationships between the features and the target variable.

Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the data to ensure it is suitable for model training. This may involve handling missing values, scaling features, and encoding categorical variables.

Feature Engineering: Based on the data exploration, engineer additional features that could potentially improve the predictive power of the models. This may involve creating lagged features, rolling averages, or other transformations to capture relevant information for predicting future price movements.

Model Selection: Consider different models suitable for time series data, such as ARIMA, SARIMA, Prophet, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). Evaluate the performance of these models using appropriate evaluation metrics and choose the one that provides the best results for the specific problem.

Model Training and Evaluation: Split the dataset into training and testing sets, ensuring the temporal order of the data is maintained. Train the chosen model on the training set, tune hyperparameters if necessary, and evaluate its performance on the testing set using evaluation metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) or Mean Absolute Error (MAE).

Model Optimization: Fine-tune the selected model by performing hyperparameter optimization. Explore different values for hyperparameters and evaluate their impact on model performance. Update the model with the optimal hyperparameters to improve its accuracy.

Deployment: Once the model is selected, trained, and optimized, deploy it to make predictions on new, unseen data. Follow best practices for deploying machine learning models, such as encapsulating the model in a function or API that can be easily accessed.

Results
After evaluating different models, the following Mean Squared Errors (MSE) were obtained:

Decision Tree: 42.55
Random Forest: 55.37
KNN (before optimization): 24.02
KNN (after optimization): 37.27
The KNN model, after optimization, achieved the lowest MSE, indicating its superior performance compared to the other models. Therefore, the optimized KNN model is recommended for stock price prediction.

Recommendations
Based on the analysis, the following recommendations can be made:

Utilize the optimized KNN model for stock price prediction, as it demonstrated the lowest MSE and thus the highest accuracy.
Regularly update and re-evaluate the model as new data becomes available to ensure its continued accuracy and relevance.
Consider further analysis and fine-tuning of the KNN model, such as exploring different distance metrics or experimenting with additional hyperparameters, to potentially improve its performance.
Continuously monitor the stock market and incorporate new features or data sources that may enhance the predictive power of the model.
Deploy the recommended model in a production environment, ensuring it is encapsulated within a function or API that allows easy access for making predictions on new, unseen data.
